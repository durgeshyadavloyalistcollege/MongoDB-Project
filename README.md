# Compliance Tracking MongoDB Document Database Design

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the design of a MongoDB document database for compliance tracking purposes. The database will facilitate the storage and retrieval of information related to audits, regulations, policies, and actions taken to ensure compliance within an organization.

## Project Requirements
- Store data related to audits, regulations, policies, and actions.
- Enable efficient querying and retrieval of compliance data.
- Ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Provide scalability to accommodate future growth and requirements.
- Facilitate easy integration with existing systems and tools.

## Data Model

### Audit Collection
- **_id**: Unique identifier for the audit.
- **audit_type**: Type of audit conducted (e.g., internal, external).
- **auditor**: Name or identifier of the auditor.
- **date**: Date of the audit.
- **findings**: List of findings discovered during the audit.
- **actions_taken**: Actions taken in response to the findings.
- **status**: Current status of the audit (e.g., pending, closed).

### Regulation Collection
- **_id**: Unique identifier for the regulation.
- **regulation_name**: Name or title of the regulation.
- **description**: Description of the regulation.
- **authority**: Regulatory authority responsible for the regulation.
- **applicable_to**: Entities or departments to which the regulation applies.
- **compliance_status**: Current compliance status (e.g., compliant, non-compliant).

### Policy Collection
- **_id**: Unique identifier for the policy.
- **policy_name**: Name or title of the policy.
- **description**: Description of the policy.
- **applicable_to**: Entities or departments to which the policy applies.
- **date_created**: Date when the policy was created.
- **last_updated**: Date when the policy was last updated.
- **owner**: Owner or responsible person for the policy.

### Action Collection
- **_id**: Unique identifier for the action.
- **action_type**: Type of action taken (e.g., corrective, preventive).
- **description**: Description of the action taken.
- **related_audit**: Reference to the audit associated with the action.
- **related_regulation**: Reference to the regulation related to the action.
- **status**: Current status of the action (e.g., open, completed).
- **due_date**: Due date for completing the action.
- **assignee**: Person or department responsible for completing the action.

### User Collection
- **_id**: Unique identifier for the user.
- **username**: Username of the user.
- **email**: Email address of the user.
- **role**: Role or position of the user within the organization.

## Conclusion
Designing a MongoDB document database for compliance tracking involves creating collections that accurately represent the entities and relationships within the compliance domain. The proposed data model provides a structured approach to store and manage audit, regulation, policy, action, and user data efficiently. With this design, the compliance tracking system can effectively meet the requirements of the organization and adapt to evolving compliance needs.
